        - Once the cards are shuffled
        - user guessed where the card is 
        - the user will be informed if the user guessed the correct loocation of the card
- The game will consist of 4 rounds
    - user awarded points depending on the round number
- Once the game is over the user will be informed of their total score and if they want to play again
